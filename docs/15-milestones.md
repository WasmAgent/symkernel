# symkernel — Milestone Plan

Symbolic verification kernel for the WasmAgent ecosystem (Go).
Provides a CEL + wazero + Z3 three-tier symbolic reasoning backend via HTTP,
language-agnostic and non-invasive to existing runtimes.

---

## Milestone 1 — Foundation & CEL Integration (Phase 0)

> Engineering validation: wire up infrastructure, not product differentiation.
> Goal: prove the integration protocol, deploy pipeline, auth, and observability work.

- [ ] `cmd/symkerneld` — HTTP server entrypoint with graceful shutdown and configurable listen address (`SYMKERNEL_ADDR`)
- [ ] `internal/cel` — cel-go expression evaluator: `Evaluate(expr string, context map[string]any) (any, error)` wrapping `cel-go` program compilation and evaluation with per-request timeout
- [ ] `internal/auth` — Bearer token middleware: validate `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against `SYMKERNEL_CLIENT_TOKEN` env var; return 401 on mismatch
- [ ] `internal/otel` — OpenTelemetry span setup: instrument every handler with `decision_id` (UUID) in span attributes and response JSON; follow GENAI_SEMCONV field naming to align with `@wasmagent/otel-exporter`
- [ ] `POST /v1/verify/cel` — OPA-envelope endpoint: `{"input":{"expr":"...","context":{...}}}` → `{"result":{"ok":true,"value":...},"decision_id":"uuid","evalMs":0.04}`; add unit tests covering: valid expr, compile error, type mismatch, timeout
- [ ] `POST /v1/verify/criterion` — wasmagent-js Criterion adapter: `{"criterion":{"id":"...","verify_method":"cel_expr","arg":{...}}}` → `{"ok":true,"criterionId":"..."}` or `{"ok":false,"criterionId":"...","hint":"..."}`; does NOT use OPA envelope (direct protocol match)
- [ ] `api/openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.1 spec covering all Phase 0 endpoints with request/response examples and error codes
- [ ] `schemas/` — sync script `make sync-schemas` that pulls `constraint-ir.schema.json` and `constraint-violation.schema.json` from `wasmagent-js/packages/compliance/schemas` at a pinned commit; CI step fails if local copy drifts
- [ ] `deploy/Dockerfile` — multi-stage build: `golang:1.22-bookworm` builder → `gcr.io/distroless/static` final image; static binary, no CGO in Phase 0
- [ ] `deploy/wrangler.toml` — Cloudflare Containers deployment config: container binding name `SYMKERNEL`, memory/vCPU sizing for Phase 0 load
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` — local dev environment: single `symkerneld` service with env vars; `docker compose up` is the quickstart
- [ ] `bench/` — comparison harness: run the 6 `policy-compliance` tasks from `bscode/fixtures/bench-v0/tasks/` against both the existing keyword+n-gram path and the new `cel_expr` path; output a markdown table of accuracy/false-positive rates
- [ ] README — 5-minute quickstart: `docker run`, example `curl` request against each endpoint, output expected

---

## Milestone 2 — Core Differentiation: wazero Sandbox (Phase 1a)

> First real differentiator: hardware-isolated code execution.

- [ ] `internal/sandbox` — wazero runtime wrapper: `Run(wasmModuleB64 string, args map[string]any, memLimitMB int, timeoutMs int) (SandboxResult, error)`; configure WASI permissions to deny filesystem/network by default; enforce memory cap via wazero `MemoryLimitPages`
- [ ] `internal/sandbox` — trap → structured error protocol: WASM traps (unreachable, memory OOB, stack overflow, timeout) mapped to `{"kind":"<trap_kind>","message":"..."}` in `SandboxResult.Trap`; all trap kinds covered by table-driven tests
- [ ] `POST /v1/sandbox/run` — OPA-envelope endpoint: `{"input":{"wasm_module_b64":"...","args":{...},"memory_limit_mb":64,"timeout_ms":5000}}` → `{"result":{"ok":true,"output":...,"trap":null},"decision_id":"uuid"}` or `{"result":{"ok":false,"trap":{"kind":"...","message":"..."}},"decision_id":"uuid"}`
- [ ] Integration test: compile a minimal WAT module that reads `args`, computes a result, and returns it; verify round-trip through `/v1/sandbox/run` produces correct output and correct `decision_id`
- [ ] Integration test: WAT module that traps on purpose (unreachable instruction); verify `trap.kind` is `"unreachable"` in response
- [ ] Integration test: WAT module that allocates beyond `memory_limit_mb`; verify `trap.kind` is `"memory_limit"` and process does not crash

---

## Milestone 3 — Core Differentiation: Z3 Formal Verification (Phase 1b)

> Second real differentiator: mathematical satisfiability proofs.

- [ ] `internal/smt` — Z3 binding via `go-z3` CGO: `Solve(smt2 string, timeoutMs int) (SMTResult, error)` returning `{Sat: "sat"|"unsat"|"unknown", Model: map[string]any, UnsatCore: []string}`
- [ ] `POST /v1/verify/z3` — OPA-envelope endpoint: `{"input":{"constraints_smt2":"...","timeout_ms":2000}}` → `{"result":{"sat":"sat","model":{...}},"decision_id":"uuid"}`; test cases: trivially sat, trivially unsat, timeout-induced unknown
- [ ] `internal/repair` — generate-error-fix loop: `Repair(program string, trapResult SandboxResult) (RepairPrompt, error)` assembles a structured prompt from trap details for LLM-driven fix; does NOT call LLM itself (caller injects); covered by unit test with a mock trap
- [ ] `deploy/Dockerfile` — update to include Z3 shared library (`libz3.so`) in final image; document CGO linker flags in Makefile
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` — add `z3` service or build Z3 from source in builder stage; document which approach is chosen and why
- [ ] Load test: measure Cloudflare Containers cold-start and p99 latency under 10 concurrent Z3 requests; record results in `bench/z3-load-test.md`; decision gate: if p99 > 2s or scale-to-zero cold start > 5s, document migration path to self-hosted VPS

---

## Milestone 4 — Schema Alignment & Upstream Collaboration (Phase 2)

- [ ] `schemas/` — `make sync-schemas` integrated into CI via `go generate ./...`; PR fails if schema drift detected; tested with an intentional drift scenario
- [ ] wasmagent-js adapter PR — `CelGoVerifier` implementation: `methods: ["cel_expr"]`, `verify()` calls `POST /v1/verify/criterion`; submitted as standalone PR to `WasmAgent/wasmagent-js` (or own fork first); does NOT touch `packages/core`
- [ ] `internal/criterion` — Go-side `Criterion` and `ConstraintIR` types generated from `schemas/*.schema.json` via `go generate`; used by `/v1/verify/criterion` handler; no hand-maintained type duplication
- [x] Evaluate `PolicyRule.evaluateAsync` upstream PR to `WasmAgent/wasmagent-js`: prototype a backwards-compatible `evaluateAsync?: (toolName, args, vetting) => Promise<InvocationDecision|undefined>` overload; submit as draft PR with benchmarks showing latency impact of pre-fetch vs. inline async
  - Go-side prototype landed in `internal/policy/policyrule.go`: `PolicyRule` with an OPTIONAL `EvaluateAsync` hook (nil = defer, preserving the pre-overload contract), `InvocationDecision`/`Vetting` mirrors of the wasmagent-js types, a `Registry` dispatcher (first-non-deferring-wins), and `Registry.Prefetch` modelling the pre-fetch vs. inline-async pattern.
  - `BenchmarkInlineVsPrefetch` in `internal/policy/policyrule_test.go` measures the latency advantage of overlapping the rule evaluation with the tool body (prefetch ≈ `max(rule, tool)` vs. inline `rule + tool`).
  - Upstream draft-PR submission to `WasmAgent/wasmagent-js` remains a cross-repo follow-up (see `cross_repo_notes` on the closing issue); the in-repo prototype is the evaluation deliverable.

## Milestone 5 — Distributed Orchestration & Policy Intelligence (Phase 2)

> Multi-tier coordination and observability: symkernel becomes a intelligent verification orchestrator, not just isolated endpoints.
> Goal: enable automatic tier selection, enterprise-grade auditability, and verification efficiency at scale.

- [ ] `internal/orchestrator` — verification routing engine: `Route(query VerificationRequest) (*TierSelection, error)` analyzing query complexity, cost targets, and accuracy requirements to automatically choose CEL vs wazero vs Z3 tier; expose routing metrics via `GET /v1/orchestration/stats`
- [ ] `internal/cache` — multi-tier caching with smart invalidation: LRU cache for CEL expressions keyed by `(expr_hash, context_hash)` with TTL-based expiry and tag-based invalidation when upstream schemas drift; expose `POST /v1/admin/cache/invalidate` for ops control
- [ ] `POST /v1/verify/orchestrated` — unified verification endpoint: `{"query":{"type":"auto","expr":"...","context":{...},"options":{"maxCostMs":500,"minConfidence":0.95}}}` → routes to optimal tier automatically with `{"result":{"tier":"cel","value":...},"routing":{"selectionReason":"expr_complexity_low","alternatives":["wazero"]}}`
- [ ] `internal/audit` — enterprise-grade audit trail: immutable append-only log of all verification decisions with `decision_id`, input hash, tier selected, result, and timestamp; implement log rotation and retention policies; export via `GET /v1/audit/export?format=jsonl&from=<timestamp>`
- [ ] `internal/diagnostics` — verification explainability: for failed verifications, generate structured explanations (`WhyFailed{"constraint":"max_memory","actual":256,"limit":128,"remediation":"reduce_allocation_or_increase_limit"}`); expose via `GET /v1/diagnostics/<decision_id>`
- [ ] `internal/batch` — bulk verification API: `POST /v1/verify/batch` accepting up to 1000 verification requests in a single payload; process in parallel with worker pool; return aggregated results with per-item status and batch-level timing statistics
- [ ] `deploy/helm/` — Kubernetes deployment charts: Helm templates for production deployment with HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling), resource limits, pod disruption budgets, and ConfigMap/Secret management for multi-environment configs
- [ ] `internal/metrics` — enhanced Prometheus metrics: expose tier selection counts, cache hit/miss ratios, per-endpoint latency histograms, and verification outcome counts; documented in `metrics/README.md` with Grafana dashboard queries

This milestone transforms symkernel from isolated verification endpoints into an intelligent, production-grade orchestration layer that automatically optimizes for cost, accuracy, and operational scale—addressing the natural next question after "can we verify?" which is "how do we verify efficiently and reliably at scale?"

## Milestone 6 — Policy Composition & Developer Experience (Phase 2)

> **From verification primitive to verification platform:** Enable sophisticated multi-tier policies and frictionless local development.

- [ ] `internal/compose` — Policy composition engine: evaluate `CEL → wazero → Z3` tier chains with configurable fallback (`any_pass`, `all_pass`, `short_circuit`) and timeout budgets per tier; expose `POST /v1/verify/composed` endpoint accepting `{"tiers":[{"type":"cel","expr":"..."},{"type":"wazero","module":"..."}],"mode":"any_pass"}`
- [ ] `internal/cache` — Multi-layer caching: L1 in-process LRU for hot CEL expressions (configurable TTL via `SYMKERNEL_CACHE_TTL_SEC`), L2 Redis-backed optional cache for cross-instance wazero compilation results; cache key = `SHA256(expr + context schema)`; invalidate on schema version bump
- [ ] `internal/explain` — Verification trace explainer: attach structured trace to every response showing which tier fired, why subsequent tiers skipped (or executed), and intermediate values; return in `trace` field aligning with OpenTelemetry decision spans; enable `?explain=true` query param
- [ ] `cmd/symk` — CLI tool for local development: `symk verify cel --expr "input.age > 18" --context ctx.json` runs offline using embedded CEL evaluator; `symk test-policy --dir policies/` batches `.yaml` policy files against fixture contexts; `symk doctor` validates connectivity and auth against remote `symkerneld`
- [ ] `policies/` — Policy definition framework (optional library): YAML DSL for composed policies with metadata, tiers, and test fixtures; `symk validate-policy` checks schema compliance; generates OpenAPI snippets for each policy
- [ ] `internal/batch` — Batch verification endpoint: `POST /v1/verify/batch` accepting `{"items":[{"expr":"...","context":{...}}...]}` → `{"results":[...],"totalMs":12}` with parallel execution (configurable concurrency limit `SYMKERNEL_BATCH_CONCURRENCY`); returns partial results on timeout with `timeout: true` flag
- [ ] `api/openapi.yaml` — Extended spec: add `/v1/verify/composed`, `/v1/verify/batch`, and `trace` response field definitions; include example policy composition YAMLs and batch request patterns
- [ ] `bench/` — Composition tier benchmarks: compare end-to-end latency for single-tier CEL vs. three-tier chains under cache cold/warm conditions; measure fallback behavior impact on tail latency (p95, p99); output trace examples for each path
- [ ] README — Add "Composed Policies" section: walkthrough of `any_pass` vs. `all_pass` modes, trace interpretation, and quickstart for `symk` CLI; include batch verification example for bulk validation workflows
